# SteNuScanner
Web Vulnerability Scanner

This scanner is inspired by the Ideas found in ZAP Proxy, Wapiti, Watobo and BurpSuite. It is a project for my master thesis and mainly focused on educational purpose.
For installation you just have to copy it to your system, run the install script in the install folder (alternativly install the packages in modules.txt) and copy the selenium drivers in a PATH directory (described in install_Driver_README.txt in folder install). 

Good Luck testing and there is always a possibility that bugs are included.
